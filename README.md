# ML_Algorithm_from_scratch

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Machine Learning algorithms from scratch** 
using only Python and core libraries like **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to understand the inner workings of ML models by building them step-by-step without relying 
on high-level frameworks such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

Do you want me to also **analyze each algorithm folder** and document what’s inside (scripts, datasets, noteboo
